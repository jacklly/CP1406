                    <h1>What is THE POINT Of Performance Appraisal</h1>

                    <p>
                        Probably the most misused and abused and disused management tool in history is the performance
appraisal. It's the strangest thing. Ask any manager or human resources person whether they think
performance appraisal is an important thing to do, they are almost unanimous. "Of course, it is", is
the common response. If you ask why it's important, they will tell you and tell you and tell you. The
odd thing is that they often don't get done, and managers, supervisors and employees hate the
darned things. Human resource professionals spend a lot of time whipping people into doing them,
while managers look for a variety of reasons to delay and delay. Why is that?
It's uncomfortable to do performance appraisals. But why is it uncomfortable? Because people
undertake them for the wrong reasons and wrong perspective, which ends up putting the manager
and the employee on different "sides". Appraisals are used for determining pay increases, who getslet
go, who gets promoted. Often, they are used to focus on what people have done wrong.

So, what isthe point of performance appraisals? Here's a starting point that actually
works. The most important purpose or goal of the appraisal is to improve
performance in the future...and not just for the employee. Managers can get valuable information
from employeesto help them make employee'sjobs more productive. Work units and organizations
can identify problems that interfere with everyone's work.
If we shift from affixing blame, to identifying barriers to performance we begin to remove the fear and
dread people have about these "appraisals". When we focus on the present and the future, we
change our focus to what's been to what can be better tomorrow.
An appraisal that works involves a number of things, but first and foremost is the process of
identifying what has gotten in the way of better performance (regardless of the level of performance),
and how manager and employee can work together in the future, to improve it. It's really that simple.
When managers put away the "blaming stick" in appraisals and move to a cooperative, dialogue
approach, the whole process can become more comfortable and effective. Because it puts the
manager and employee on the same side, and working towards the same goals, getting better and
better.
Sure, we do use appraisals for a number of reasons but if we are going to get real value out of the
time and energy we put into them, we have to look at the process in a more constructive way. And,
bottom line, that's making performance better.
